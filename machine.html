                <h1>The Task Our Machine Solves</h1><br>
                <p>Our machine is a mini lift made from a box, designed to
                    raise and lower small objects using only human power. The main problem
                    it solves is how to move items vertically with minimal effort, which is a common
                    challenge in everyday life. Let's think of lifting groceries to a higher shelf or moving books
                    between floors. This model shows how simple machines can make lifting easier and more efficient,
                    even with basic materials.</p>

                <h1>Mechanical Principles Involved</h1><br>
                <p>The main mechanical principle used in our lift is the use of a pulley system.
                    In our design, a piece of straw acts as the axle, and a string(which is a thread) is wound
                    around it.
                    When we turn the handle (which is connected to the straw), the string winds up, pulling the lift
                    platform upwards. This setup uses the principle of mechanical advantage: By turning the
                    handle,we can lift a
                    heavier load with less force
                    than if we tried to pull the platform straight up by hand.</p>
                <p>There's also a bit of energy transfer happening. The hand's turning motion
                    (mechanical energy) is transferred through the handle and straw, converting
                    rotational motion into the upward movement of the platform. The design minimizes
                    wasted effort by making the turning smooth and reducing friction as much as possible.</p>

        <h1>Reflections on Energy Efficiency & User-Centered Design</h1><br>
        <p>We tried to make our lift as energy efficient as possible by ensuring the spool turned easily and the string
            didn't snag. The platform is stable,
            so objects don't fall off while being lifted. We also made sure everything was safe, no sharp edges, and the
            lift moves slowly enough that nothing gets damaged.</p><br>
        <p>From a user-centered design perspective, we wanted the lift to be intuitive. Anyone can look at it and
            understand how to use it. Just turn the handle to go up, and unwind it to go down.
            We mainly used boxes and thread, making it eco-friendly.</p>

        <h1>Final Thoughts</h1><br>
        <p>Building this lift was a fun way to see physics in action. It's amazing how much easier a simple machine
            can make a tough job. We learned a lot about mechanical advantages and how important it is to think about
            the user
            when designing something, even if it's just made from a box.</p>
