 <h2>Our Mission</h2>
 <p>Our mission is to apply engineering thinking to explore, understand, and solve real-world challenges. Through each project, <br> we strive to deepen our grasp of technical concepts while developing solutions that are practical, innovative, and meaningful.</p>
    
  <h3>What We Do</h3>
  <p>Our projects span a variety of domains within engineering and beyond.   Whether designing a pulley system,  <br> or modeling biological systems through a board game, we take a structured, analytical approach <br> rooted in engineering fundamentals.</p>
  <div class="team-work">
     <h3>Each project reflects:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Teamwork and cross-functional collaboration</li>
      <li>Critical thinking and iterative problem-solving</li>
      <li>Creativity in applying theoretical knowledge to practical tasks</li>
    </ul>
